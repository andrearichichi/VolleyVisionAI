# Sport Vision AI
Sport Vision AI is an innovative solution aimed at revolutionizing the way sports events are analyzed and showcased. By leveraging cutting-edge computer vision algorithms and artificial intelligence, this software enables users to create customized video clips from selected sequences of sports events. Sport Vision AI offers the flexibility to choose between manual configuration, importing event files from specialized software like DataVolley, or utilizing computer vision models for automatic sequence identification.

Once created, these video clips can be further enriched with valuable information through the application of computer vision algorithms. These algorithms are engineered to extract critical details from the footage, such as ball trajectories and identifying involved players, thereby providing a deeper understanding of the game dynamics.

Sport Vision AI is designed for coaches, sports analysts, players, and enthusiasts looking to gain insights into sports events through video analysis. Whether the goal is to enhance game strategies, study opponent performances, or simply enjoy personalized highlight reels, Sport Vision AI is the ideal tool for transforming video sequences into rich sources of insights.

The project is a collaborative effort initiated by Maurizio Napolitano (FBK) and Andrea Richichi (UNITN).<IMG SRC="images/logo_volleyvisionai.svg" ALIGN="right" HSPACE="50" VSPACE="50"/>   
Originating as an internship project by Andrea at the Fondazione Bruno Kessler (FBK), with Maurizio serving as the tutor.
